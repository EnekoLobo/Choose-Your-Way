LANGUAGES
---------
Different languages can be used with the JukeBox so each client can use it easily.
---------
If you want to submit a finished language to be added to the JukeBox, open a ticket on ScriptFodder.
Make sure to title it something I will understand easily at first galce.

To create a new language, copy the lines from:
JukeBox.Lang.Languages["English"] = {
to:
}
and paste it in the space provided. Then change the "English" in the [] to "Your Language Name".
Saving this file and changing level should make the new language appear in the JukeBox list.

Also, if you need help, feel free to message me on ScriptFodder.
