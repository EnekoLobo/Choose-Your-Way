WEB FILES
---------
The web files are what the JukeBox uses to search for, get the length of and check YouTube videos.
---------
If you want to host the web files youself, please message me on ScriptFodder here:
https://scriptfodder.com/dashboard/messages/new/76561198054105945
I can then send you the 3 needed files. I will also message you if and when the web files get updated.
I havn't included them with the download so that people don't think they need to use them.

While I recommend sticking with the provided links as the web code will update automatically,
I'm fine with giving out the web code.

Also, if you need help, feel free to message me on ScriptFodder.
